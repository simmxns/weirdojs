## Getting start
This is a complete project for the development of a quiz made with the strongtyped 'typescript'

It consists of a quiz game of 20 questions where the questions are related to the weird things I found about **javascript**. You must answer by selecting (you can use the keyboard too!) one of the given answers. Your score will be higher if you solve it in a short time and with more correct questions. In the end, you can see you on the leaderboard.

Much success!

### Technologies

  * Mongoose
  * Adonisjs

## Set up
```bash
# copy this script and leave it be
git clone 'https://github.com/simmxns/weirdojs.git'
cd weirdojs/api/ && npm i
cd ../app/ && npm i
cd ..
```
Now you can work properly on both directories
