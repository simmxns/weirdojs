## Getting start
This is a complete project for the development of a quiz made with the strongtyped 'typescript'

It consists of a quiz game of 20 questions where the questions are related to the weird things I found about js. You must answer by selecting (you can use the keyboard too!) one of the given answers and. Your score will be higher if you solve it in a short time and with more correct questions In the end, you can see what position you were in.

Much success!
